**Points to Work on:**
- improve UI
- make a new google sheet for each csv in user's drive
- optimize for large files
- feature to detect the delimiter of the CSV file automatically and let the user change it if needed. 
- feature to validate the data before importing it and show any errors or warnings to the user.
- feature to transform the data before importing it and let the user apply some common operations such as sorting, filtering, grouping, aggregating, pivoting, or formatting. 
- feature to save the import settings and let the user reuse them for future imports. 
- A cancel button that allows users to stop the file upload or the data import at any time, in case they change their mind or want to select a different file or sheet.
- A progress bar or a spinner that shows the status of the file upload and the data import, so that users can see how long it will take and if there are any errors or interruptions.
